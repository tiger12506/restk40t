In order to facilitate live dev environment, I followed what happens when you do a:
python3 setup.py install

It creates an egg file in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages.
I extract that egg, rename all the module-verion-py3.7 crap to just module, and then
rename EGG-INFO to module.egg-info.

Finally, I remove the installed module directory, and symbolic link to my dev folder.
I can now skip having to run python3 setup.py install, and can just restart meerk40t
to reload the updated plugin.
